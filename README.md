# NeuralNet
Program to visualize Linear Perceptron Model without using any Data Science library. 


#### 5000Points_Folder 
-> Contains GIF example of the Training run<br/>.
-> Performance.txt has all the measures used for the run and Model Accuracy

#### Data_generator
Program to generate random blob like data. Sample size can be tuned accordingly. I have chosen for 5000 points.


### Linear_Perceptron
Main program to visualize perceptron
